## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It’s a different approach from frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize, which provide pre-styled components. With Tailwind, you're given the tools to build your own components.

This means you can create a highly customized look and feel without writing a single line of custom CSS. The development process is faster because you don't have to switch between your HTML and CSS files.

### Core Concepts

- **Utility Classes:** Instead of writing CSS rules, you apply existing classes directly in your HTML.
- **Responsive Design:** Use variants like `md:` or `lg:` to apply styles at different breakpoints.
- **Just-in-Time Compiler:** The JIT engine generates your CSS on-demand by scanning your template files, resulting in lightning-fast build times and a tiny production bundle.

Here is an example of a simple card component:

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Tailwind CSS is perfect for developers who want complete control over their styling and a more efficient workflow.
